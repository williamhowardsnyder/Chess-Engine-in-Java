# Chess-Engine-in-Java

Created a chess engine in the Java programming language that uses a minimax search algorithm to find the best moves. I stuck fairly close to the tutorial by Software Architecture and Design (here's a link to the first video in the series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8fSdSUKttk&list=PLOJzCFLZdG4zk5d-1_ah2B4kqZSeIlWtt) in order to complete this project, but I added additional functionality that was not included in the tutorial, such as alpha-beta pruning to increase search efficiency. The goal of this project was to gain a better understanding of object-oriented programming in larger scale projects, and learn how to properly interact with other peopleâ€™s code. Even though not all the code is mine I learned a lot through this project and intend to add more features.
